Hi, I’m Pkacper04
I make programs in python, and I hope to study more about this programming language.
My apps are for sure easy to make and have a lot of problems, but this helps me to learn more and more and what to improve.
If you want to say something that I do wrong go ahead I want to listen to all your opinions, and maybe you can help by a little, and it would be really nice.
So I hope you will like my apps and help me improve more. Thanks.
